What is the vulnerable time for this network? 1.4 What is the general idea behind CSMA methods? 1.5 Briefly describe the persistence methods for CSMA. What are they used for? 1.6 Can collisions be detected in wireless networks? Why/why not? 1.7 How can channels be divided (for channelization methods)? 1.8 What is the idea behind CDMA? How are codes generated? 1.9 Alice and Bob are experimenting with CDMA using a 𝐖𝟐 Walsh table. Alice uses the code 𝑪𝟏 = [+𝟏, +𝟏] and Bob uses the code 𝑪𝟐 = [+𝟏, −𝟏]. Assume that they simultaneously send a hexadecimal digit to each other. Alice sends 𝟔𝟏𝟔 and Bob sends 𝐁𝟏𝟔. Show how they can detect what the other person has sent (with computations for all “steps” for a single bit).","libVersion":"0.2.4","langs":""}
