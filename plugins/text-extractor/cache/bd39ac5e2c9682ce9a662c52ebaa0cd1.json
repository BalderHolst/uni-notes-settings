The standard was approved by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1987. IEEE had subdivided the Data Link layer into Logical Link Control (LLC) and Media Access Control (MAC). IEEE had also made different physical-Layer standards for different LAN protocols. Data Link layer IEEE Standards: Standard Ethernet Originally, The Ethernet LAN was developed in the 1970s by Robert Metcalfe and David Boggs. Since then, it has gone through four generations as the demands for higher data rate have been increasing, we will look at 3 of them: Data Link layer Standard Ethernet: Frame format for MAC-frame • Ethernet has no mechanisms to acknowledge received frames. • Therefore, it is considered an unreliable medium. • If a receipt is to be received for received frames, it must be implemented in higher layers. Data Link layer Standard Ethernet: Frame format for MAC-frame Preamble: This field consists of 7 bytes (56 bits) of alternating 0s and 1s. The field is used to alert the receiver to the coming frame and allows the receiver to synchronize its clock with the sender. In fact, this field is actually added at the physical layer and is therefore not officially part of the frame. Data Link layer Standard Ethernet: Frame format for MAC-frame Start frame delimiter (SFD): This field has 1 byte and contains a constant value 10101011. It signals the start of a frame. The receiver is warned that this is the last chance to get ready to receive the coming frame. This field is also added at the physical Layer. Data Link layer Standard Ethernet: Frame format for MAC-frame Destination address (DA): This field has 6 bytes and contains the link-layer address of the destination station or stations, i.e.,receiver(s). Data Link layer Standard Ethernet: Frame format for MAC-frame Source address (SA): This field has 6 bytes and contains the link-layer address of the sender of the packet. Data Link layer Standard Ethernet: Frame format for MAC-frame Length or Type: The standard Ethernet uses this field for type indication, while IEEE uses the field to specify the number of bytes in the data field. Both statements are common today. If type is used, this value is larger than 1536 (0x0600) and indicates the upper-layer protocol whose packet is encapsulated in the frame. Here, interpackets gap (which is the distance between frames = 12 byte) is used to detect the frame length. E.g.: 0x0806 = ARP and 0x86DD = IPv6 Data Link layer Standard Ethernet: Frame format for MAC-frame Data: This field contains data encapsulated from the upper layers. The size is between 46 and 1500 bytes. If data in this field is less than 46 bytes, then 0s are inserted (padding). Data Link layer Standard Ethernet: Frame format for MAC-frame CRC: This field contains error detection information, in this case CRC-32. Data Link layer Standard Ethernet: Frame length Ethernet has restrictions on both the minimum and maximum lengths of a frame. The minimum length is a requirement for the proper functioning of CSMA/CD. It is set to be at least 512 bits or 64 bytes. The reason is that the transmission time for a frame (Tfr) must be at least 2xTp (propagation) for collision detection. If the upper layer delivers less than 46 bytes to the MAC layer, then some padding is conducted to fit. Data Link layer Standard Ethernet: Frame length Ethernet has restrictions on both the minimum and maximum lengths of a frame. The maximum limit has two historical reasons. • In the early days of Ethernet, memory was very expensive. By limiting the size, one could also limit the size of buffers. • The maximum limit should help ensure that a station does not monopolize the shared medium for too long at a time. Data Link layer Standard Ethernet: Addressing Each station on an Ethernet network (such as a PC, workstation, or printer) has its own Network Interface Card (NIC). The NIC fits inside the station and provides the station with a link-layer address. The Ethernet address is 6 bytes (48 bits), normally written in hexadecimal notation, with a colon between the bytes. Data Link layer Standard Ethernet: Unicast, Multicast and Broadcast addresses A source address is always a unicast address, the frame only comes from one station. But the destination address can be unicast, multicast or broadcast addresses. • If the least significant bit (lsb) in the first byte is 0, then it is a unicast address. • If the lsb in the first byte is 1, then it is a multicast address. • If all bits in the address are 1 (FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF), then it is a broadcast address. Data Link layer Standard Ethernet Access method Standard Ethernet uses CSMA/CD with 1-persistent method. Slot time The slot time is referred to as the time it takes to send 512 bits. This means that the slot time depends on the data rate. For traditional 10-Mbps Ethernet, the slot time is 51,2µs. Data Link layer Standard Ethernet Slot time and collision detection The choice of a 512-bit slot time is not random. It is selected for CSMA/CD to work properly. In Ethernet, roundtrip time is the time it takes for a frame to be transmitted from one end of a network to the other and back again. This is equivalent to two nodes (A and B) furthest apart in a network doing the following: • Node A transmits 512 bit. • Just before the first of the 512 bits arrives at node B, B also sends 512 bits. • When B’s first bit arrives at A, then A must not have sent its last bit. Remember A and B only do collision detection while transmitting!

Data Link layer Standard Ethernet Slot time and maximum network length There is a relationship between the slot time and the maximum length of a network (the collision domain). It depends on the propagation rate. In most transmission media, signals move at a speed of 2x108 m/s (equivalent to 2/3 of the propagation rate in air). We can thus calculate: However, we should also consider delays in repeaters and interfaces, as well as the time required to send jam signals. These circumstances in practice reduce the maximum length to 2500 m (48% of the theoretical value). max 𝑙𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑡ℎ = 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑝𝑎𝑔𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒 ∙ 𝑆𝑙𝑜𝑡 𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒 2 max 𝑙𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑡ℎ = 2 ∙ 108 ∙ 51.2 ∙ 10−6 2 = 5120 𝑚 Data Link layer Standard Ethernet: Physical layer Standard Ethernet defines a number of physical layer implementations. But only four of them became popular during the 1980s. UTP = Unshielded Twisted Pair. Data Link layer Standard Ethernet: Physical layer Standard Ethernet uses Manchester coding Media Data Link layer 10Base5: Thick Ethernet This was the first specification of Ethernet that used bus topology with an external transceiver (transmitter/receiver) connected via a tap to a thick coaxial cable. The cables were large and difficult to bend. Data Link layer 10Base2: Thin Ethernet 10Base2 also uses a bus topology, but with thinner cables and cheaper hardware. Data Link layer 10Base-T: Twisted-pair Ethernet. 10Base-T uses a star topology. The stations are connected to a hub via two pairs of twisted cables. (2 pairs = 1 pair for sending and 1 for receiving) In this setup, the maximum length of the cables is set to 100 m, to minimize the effect of attenuation in the twisted cable. Data Link layer 10Base-F: Fiber Ethernet Star topology is also used here. For each connection, one fiber is used for sending and the other one for receiving.

This actually opened up opportunities to evolve Ethernet so that it became compatible with other high-speed LANs. Data Link layer Changes in standard: Bridged Ethernet Splitting the collision domain means greater mean bandwidth Bandwidth is shared between 6 stations and the bridge (average bandwidth 10/7 Mbps) Bandwidth is shared between 12 stations (average bandwidth 10/12 Mbps) Data Link layer Changes in standard: Bridged Ethernet Another example Bandwidth is shared between three stations and the bridge. (average bandwidth 2.5 Mbps or 10/4 Mbps) Data Link layer Changes in standard: Switched Ethernet A layer-2 switch is an N-port Bridge, which with additional sophistication, that allows faster handling of the packets. (5 Mbps for each) Data Link layer Changes in standard: Full-Duplex Switched Ethernet One of the limitations of 10Base5 og 10Base2 is that communication takes place in half-duplex (10Base-T is always full-duplex). This will increase the capacity of each domain from 10 Mbps to 20 Mbps. This means that collision detection is no longer needed as each station is connected to the switch via two separate links. Each link can be considered a point-to-point connection, where the data stream only goes one way. Data Link layer Changes in standard: MAC control Since standard Ethernet was designed as a connectionless protocol without Flow- and Error-control. Then it was necessary to add a layer in between the LLC layer and the MAC layer that could handle these controls. This layer is called MAC Control Layer. Data Link layer Fast Ethernet Fast Ethernet was designed to compete with other high-speed LAN protocols. IEEE created Fast Ethernet as standard 802.3u. Fast Ethernet is backward compatible with Standard Ethernet, but the speed is 10 times higher with a data rate of 100 Mbps. The following goals for Fast Ethernet can be summarized: 1. Upgrade the speed to 100 Mbps. 2. Make it compatible with Standard Ethernet. 3. Keep the same 48-bit MAC address. 4. Keep the same Frame format. 5. Maintain the same minimum and maximum lengths for frames. Data Link layer Fast Ethernet: Autonegotiation A new feature is added and called Autonegotiation (automatic negotiation) The purpose is as follows: • Allow incompatible devices to connect to each other. E.g., 10Mbps device can communicate with 100Mbps device. • Allow one device to have multiple capabilities. • Allow a station to check the capabilities of a hub. Data Link layer Fast Ethernet: Physical layer The physical layer of Fast Ethernet is more complex than Standard Ethernet. Two stations can be connected as Point-To-Point and three or more stations need to be connected in star topology (with a hub or switch in the middle). Data Link layer Fast Ethernet: Physical layer Fast Ethernet implementation at the physical layer can be categorized as either two-wire or four-wire implementation. • Two-wire: category 5 UTP (100Base-TX), fiber-optic cable (100Base-FX). • Four-wire: category 3 UTP (100Base-T4). (the higher the category number the better the shielding and quality, and thus the higher possible speed) Data Link layer Fast Ethernet: Encoding If you want to do Manchester coding for data speed of 100Mbps, then it requires a bandwidth of 200 Mbaud. This makes Manchester coding unusable for twisted-pair cables, which do not have such high bandwidth. Fast Ethernet designers sought some alternative encoding/decoding scheme. Three different encoding schemes were chosen for three different implementations. Data Link layer Fast Ethernet: Encoding 3 methods 4B/5B: Block encoder 4 bit to 5 bit NRZ-I: Non Return to Zero, Invert MLT-3: Multi Line Transmission, 3 level 8B6T: 8 data bits and 6 signal elements Data Link layer Fast Ethernet: Summary Characteristics 100Base-TX 100Base-FX 100Base-T4 Medium category 5 UTP or STP fiber category 3 UTP Number of wires 2 2 4 Max. length 100 m 100 m 100 m Block coding 4B/5B 4B/5B none Line coding MLT-3 NRZ-I 8B6T Data Link layer Gigabit Ethernet The need for even faster data speeds led to the design of the Gigabit Ethernet protocol. IEEE has given it the name standard 802.3z. The following Gigabit Ethernet targets can be summarized: 1. Upgrade the speed to 1 Gbps. 2. Make it compatible with Standard and Fast Ethernet. 3. use the same 48-bit MAC address. 4. Keep the same frame format. 5. Maintain the same minimum and maximum lengths for Frames. 6. Support autonegotiation as defined in Fast Ethernet. Data Link layer Gigabit Ethernet: MAC sublayer One of the main considerations in the development of Gigabit Ethernet was to keep the MAC sublayer untouched. But this was no longer possible if one wanted to achieve 1Gbps. Gigabit Ethernet has two distinctive approaches for medium access: • Half-duplex. • Full-duplex. Data Link layer Gigabit Ethernet: MAC sublayer – Full-Duplex mode • In Full-duplex, there is a central switch, which is connected to all stations or switches. • Here, each switch has a buffer in all input ports, which holds data until it is sent. • Since the switch divides the collision domain into N domains, there are no collisions, therefore CDMA/CD is not used. • This means that the length of the cables is determined by the attenuation of the cables, and not by the collision detection algorithm (CD). 3 methods are defined: • Traditional • Carrier Extention • Frame Bursting. Traditional: here the same minimum length is used on the frame as in traditional Ethernet (512bit). But since the length of a bit is 1/100 shorter in Gigabit Ethernet than in traditional Ethernet (10Mbps), the slot time is reduced to 0.512µs, which means that collision is detected 100 times earlier, which in turn means that the cable length can only be 25 m. Data Link layer Gigabit Ethernet: MAC sublayer – Half-Duplex mode (rarely used only) Data Link layer Gigabit Ethernet: MAC sublayer – Half-Duplex mode (only rarely used) Carrier Extention: to allow a longer (larger) network, we increase the minimum length of a frame. Here, the minimum frame length is defined as 512 bytes = 4096 bit. This means that the minimum length is increased 8 times. This also increases the cable length 8 times to 200 m (100 m from station to hub). If less than 4096 bit is to be transmitted, bit padding is used. Frame Bursting: Carrier Extension is very inefficient if only short messages (bit padding and redundant bits) are sent. Instead of adding extension to each frame, more frames are sent. But to make these multiple frames look like a frame, bit-padding is added in between the frames. This makes the many frames look like one, and since the medium is not idle between the frames, other stations are deceived into thinking that only a very large frame has been transmitted. Data Link layer Gigabit Ethernet: Physical layer Two stations can be connected in Point-To-Point. Three or more stations are connected in star, with a switch or hub in the center. Data Link layer Gigabit Ethernet: Physical layer Gigabit Ethernet can be categorized as either two-wire or four-wire implementation. • Two-wire: Fiber-optic cable: 1000Base-SX (short-wave), 1000Base-LX (long-wave), copper cable: 1000Base-CX (STP). • Four-wire: 1000Base-T (Category 5 UTP) Data Link layer Gigabit Ethernet: Encoding NRZ: 8B/10B: 4D-PAM5: Non Return to Zero Block coding 8bit to 10 bit Four-Dimentional Five-level Pulse Amplitude Modulation Data Link layer Gigabit Ethernet: Summary Characteristics 1000Base-SX 1000Base-LX 1000Base-CX 1000Base-T Medium Fiber (short wave) Fiber (long wave) STP Category 5 UTP Number of wires 2 2 2 4 Max. length 550 m 5000 m 25 m 100 m Block coding 8B/10B 8B/10B 8B/10B none Line coding NRZ NRZ NRZ 4D-PAM5","libVersion":"0.2.4","langs":""}
