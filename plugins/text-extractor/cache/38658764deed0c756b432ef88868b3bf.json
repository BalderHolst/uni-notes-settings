Nodes may be connected to common link (multipoint), where the medium (channel) needs to be shared by multiple nodes and therefore requires a protocol to manage multiple-access. 1.2 Briefly describe the three types of methods for media access control. Random Access All stations have same superior- ity, i.e., no station has more pri- ority than another station. Each station can transmit when it de- sires on the condition that it fol- lows the protocol, including test- ing the state of the medium. Controlled Access The data is sent by that station which is approved by all other stations. The stations seek infor- mation from one another to de- termine which station has the right to send. Only one node sends at a time. Channelization The available bandwidth of the link is shared in time, fre- quency or code amongst dif- ferent stations, which allows multiple stations to access the shared channel simultane- ously.

First, the average frame transmission time 𝑇𝑓𝑟 is 𝑇𝑓𝑟 = 1000 bits 1 Mbps = 1 ms The vulnerable time is then 2 × 𝑇𝑓𝑟 → 2 × 1 ms = 2 ms Meaning that no station should send later than 1 ms before this station starts transmission and no station should start sending during the period (1 ms) that this station is sending. 1.4 What is the general idea behind CSMA methods? Carrier sense multiple access (CSMA) requires that each station first listens to the medium before sending, which can decrease the risk of collisions. In other words, CSMA is based on the principle “sense before transmit” or “listen before talk.” 1.5 Briefly describe the persistence methods for CSMA. What are they used for? Persistence methods define how a station acts in case a channel is busy. 1-Persistent After the station finds the line idle, it sends its frame immedi- ately (with probability of 1). Non-persistent If the line is idle, a station sends a frame immediately. If the line is not idle, it waits a random amount of time and then senses the line again. 𝒑-persistent Used in time-slotted protocols. If the line is idle, with probabil- ity 𝑝, the station sends its frame; otherwise (𝑞 = 1 − 𝑝), the station waits a slot and sense the channel again. 1.6 Can collisions be detected in wireless networks? Why/why not? In a wireless system, much of the energy is lost in the transmission itself. Therefore, a collision may add only 5-10% extra energy. This provides no effective way to detect collisions. 1.7 How can channels be divided (for channelization methods)? Frequency The Frequency Division Multiple Access method divides the bandwidth into multiple fre- quency bands, allocating a band per node. Time The Time Division Multiple Ac- cess method divides the entire bandwidth into multiple time seg- ments, allocating a segment per node. Coding The Code Division Multiple Access uses a shared com- munication channel by encod- ing the data to be transmitted. KOM Questions Lecture 5a Media Access Control Page 3 of 3 1.8 What is the idea behind CDMA? How are codes generated? The Code Division Multiple Access doesn’t physically divide the medium, but uses the channel as a shared communication channel. This is achieved by encoding the data to be transmitted, where each node uses a designated code (chip) for encoding. The transmission must occur synchronously, sending the encoded data bit by bit, where the data on the channel is the sum of all the signal elements. The codes, specifically named chip sequences, are generated using Walsh table so that they oblige the required properties. A Walsh table for 𝑠 = 2 nodes is a 2 × 2 matrix, where each row corresponds to the code for a particular node. 1.9 Alice and Bob are experimenting with CDMA using a 𝐖𝟐 Walsh table. Alice uses the code 𝑪𝟏 = [+𝟏, +𝟏] and Bob uses the code 𝑪𝟐 = [+𝟏, −𝟏]. Assume that they simultaneously send a hexadecimal digit to each other. Alice sends 𝟔𝟏𝟔 and Bob sends 𝐁𝟏𝟔. Show how they can detect what the other person has sent (with computations for all “steps” for a single bit). First, for Alice and Bob, the bit-sequences are encoded 616 = 01102 → −1 +1 +1 −1 , B16 = 10112 → +1 −1 +1 +1 To transmit the first bit (most significant bit) of the encoded sequences, the encoded bits are converted −1⏟ 𝑑1 ⋅ [+1, +1]⏟ 𝐶1 = [−1, −1] , +1⏟ 𝑑2 ⋅ [+1, −1]⏟ 𝐶2 = [+1, −1] The shared data sequence is then 𝑑𝑠 = [−1, −1] + [+1, −1] = [0, −2] Given the shared data sequence 𝑑𝑠 and 𝑠 = 2, Bob can decode Alice’s bit, as 𝑑1 = [0, −2] ⋅ [+1, +1] 2 = 0 − 2 2 = −1 = 02","libVersion":"0.2.4","langs":""}
