It can be solved by: • Using a geometric approach. • Decomposing the problem into a series of transformation matrices. ??? 8 Forward Kinematics for 2R Planar Manipulator Decomposing into Transformation Matrices Objective: Obtain 𝑥𝑥, 𝑦𝑦 Given: • Joint angles: 𝑞𝑞1and 𝑞𝑞2 • Length of links: 𝐿𝐿1and 𝐿𝐿2 By: • Choosing appropriate frames • Calculating their transformations Hint: • A 2D rotation matrix around the axis perpendicular to the plane is given by: 𝑹𝑹𝑧𝑧 𝜃𝜃 = cos 𝑞𝑞1 −sin 𝑞𝑞1 sin 𝑞𝑞1 cos 𝑞𝑞1 Exercise: Work in small groups (10 minutes) 9 Forward Kinematics for 2R Planar Manipulator Decomposing into Transformation Matrices One possible solution: 1 0𝑻𝑻 = cos 𝑞𝑞1 −sin 𝑞𝑞1 𝐿𝐿1� cos 𝑞𝑞1 sin 𝑞𝑞1 cos 𝑞𝑞1 𝐿𝐿1� sin 𝑞𝑞1 0 0 1 2 1𝑻𝑻 = cos 𝑞𝑞2 −sin 𝑞𝑞2 𝐿𝐿2� cos 𝑞𝑞2 sin 𝑞𝑞2 cos 𝑞𝑞2 𝐿𝐿2� sin 𝑞𝑞2 0 0 1 2 0𝑻𝑻 = 1 0𝑻𝑻2 1𝑻𝑻 = cos(𝑞𝑞1+ 𝑞𝑞2) −sin(𝑞𝑞1+ 𝑞𝑞2) 𝐿𝐿1� cos 𝑞𝑞1+ 𝐿𝐿2� cos(𝑞𝑞1+ 𝑞𝑞2) sin(𝑞𝑞1+ 𝑞𝑞2) cos(𝑞𝑞1+ 𝑞𝑞2) 𝐿𝐿1� sin 𝑞𝑞1+ 𝐿𝐿2� sin(𝑞𝑞1+ 𝑞𝑞2) 0 0 1 𝐿𝐿1 𝐿𝐿2 1 2 0 10 Forward Kinematics for 2R Planar Manipulator Decomposing into Transformation Matrices Another possible solution (more convenient): 1 0𝑻𝑻 = cos 𝑞𝑞1 −sin 𝑞𝑞1 0 sin 𝑞𝑞1 cos 𝑞𝑞1 0 0 0 1 2 1𝑻𝑻 = cos 𝑞𝑞2 −sin 𝑞𝑞2 𝐿𝐿1 sin 𝑞𝑞2 cos 𝑞𝑞2 0 0 0 1 3 2𝑻𝑻 = 1 0 𝐿𝐿2 0 1 0 0 0 1 2 0𝑻𝑻 = 1 0𝑻𝑻2 1𝑻𝑻3 2𝑻𝑻 = cos(𝑞𝑞1+ 𝑞𝑞2) −sin(𝑞𝑞1+ 𝑞𝑞2) 𝐿𝐿1� cos 𝑞𝑞1+ 𝐿𝐿2� cos(𝑞𝑞1+ 𝑞𝑞2) sin(𝑞𝑞1+ 𝑞𝑞2) cos(𝑞𝑞1+ 𝑞𝑞2) 𝐿𝐿1� sin 𝑞𝑞1+ 𝐿𝐿2� sin(𝑞𝑞1+ 𝑞𝑞2) 0 0 1 𝐿𝐿1 𝐿𝐿2 1 2 3 0 11 Forward Kinematics for 2R Planar Manipulator Trigonometric Solution Note that this robot is so simple, that we could also calculate the solution using trigonometry: 𝑥𝑥 = 𝐿𝐿1� 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 𝑞𝑞1 + 𝐿𝐿2� 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 𝑞𝑞1+ 𝑞𝑞2 𝑦𝑦 = 𝐿𝐿1� 𝑐𝑐𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 𝑞𝑞1 + 𝐿𝐿2� 𝑐𝑐𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 𝑞𝑞1+ 𝑞𝑞2 Real robots are rarely that simple. Part II: Parametrizing a Robot 13 What do we want to achieve? Forward Kinematics can always be calculated analytically. The problem is that there is no standard way: • To place frames. • To compactly describe a robot. Therefore, we want to: Describe a robot in a set of parameters, so that its structure is completely well-defined with only these parameters. 14 What do we need to parametrize a robot? We need a standardized way to: 1. Describe how joints are placed on links. 2. Describe how coordinate frames are placed on joints. One such standard are DH Parameters, named after Denavit and Hartenberg [1]. There are many variations, the most well-known being: • Standard DH Parameters [1] • Modified DH (used by J. Craig, i.e., in your book) [1] J. Denavit, R. S. Hartenberg: A kinematic notation for lower pair mechanism based on matrices. In: Journal of Applied Mechanics, 1955. 15 Types of Robot Joints (Recap) Joints can be of different types depending on how they allow motion: Revolute Prismatic Cylindrical Spherical Planar …and others Source: https://gepettoweb.laas.fr/doc/stack-of-tasks/pinocchio/master/doxygen-html/md_doc_c-maths_c-joints.html 16 Types of Robot Joints (Recap) Six possible so-called lower pair joint types result from two surfaces sliding over each other.

Revolute joint – basic joint type to control the rotation around 1 axis (e.g. turret or hinge). All other joints can be described as a combination of: 18 In-class Exercise Describe the following in terms of combinations of prismatic and revolute joints: Screw Cylindrical Spherical Planarhttps://mechanical-engg.com/blogs/entry/949-types-of-kinematic-pairs/ Discuss with the classThis is a bit of a joker… Describe instead what the input/output are. 19 In-class Exercise: Solution Describe the following in terms of combinations of prismatic and revolute joints: Screw Cylindrical Spherical Planar Input: angle of screw turn Output: horizontal displacement 1 prismatic + 1 revolute 3 revolute 2 prismatic + 1 revoluatehttps://mechanical-engg.com/blogs/entry/949-types-of-kinematic-pairs/ 20 Joints: Connections between Links Joints connect different links, allowing relative motion between them. JointLink Link 21 Links: Connections between Axes The kinematic function of a link is to maintain a fixed relationship between two axes. (The axes may not be visible from the link’s form.) The axes can have the following relationships: Skew axes Intersecting axes Parallel axes Parts based on Kinematics Lecture Slides by Christian Schlette, Professor, SDU Robotics 22 Two Axes in Space: Possible Relationships Skew axes Intersecting axes Parallel axes Parts based on Kinematics Lecture Slides by Christian Schlette, Professor, SDU Robotics 23 Parametrizing Links 𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖−1 𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖−1 Link i-1 Axis iAxis i-1 All possible relationships (including intersecting and parallel axes) between two axes in space can be described by two parameters: Link length 𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖−1 Link twist 𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖−1 24 Parametrizing Connections between Links (Joints) 𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖−1 𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖−1 Link i-1 Axis i Link i 𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖 𝜃𝜃𝑖𝑖 𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖 Axis i-1 In addition, joints need a joint variable to describe their motion.

We can then concatenate the transformations: 𝑁𝑁 0𝑻𝑻 = 1 0𝑻𝑻 2 1𝑻𝑻 3 2𝑻𝑻 … 𝑁𝑁 𝑁𝑁−1𝑻𝑻 Each transformation depends on one variable, either: • 𝜃𝜃𝑖𝑖 if revolute or • 𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖 if prismatic Therefore, the forward kinematics depends on 𝑵𝑵 variables. 42 Offset frames Base frame and Tool frame 𝟎𝟎 𝑵𝑵 𝑩𝑩 𝑻𝑻 We are usually interested in calculating the position of the tool in the base frame. DH parameters are missing these two frames: • They start the first link (frame {0}), not the base. • They end at the last link (frame {𝑁𝑁}, called Wrist frame), not the tool. We need to extend the forward kinematics by adding two offset frames, {B} and {T}: 𝑇𝑇 𝐵𝐵𝑻𝑻 = 0 𝐵𝐵𝑻𝑻 𝑁𝑁 0𝑻𝑻 𝑇𝑇 𝑁𝑁𝑻𝑻 43 Recap: What have we discussed today • All lower pair joints can be described as a combination of revolute and prismatic joints. • Joints connect together links, allowing relative motion between them. • DH Parameters allow us to describe a link using four parameters:  They describe the relationship between two axes that the link connects.  Three of these parameters are fixed and one is a joint variable. • There are multiple conventions for DH Parameters (e.g. Craig’s Modified notation and Standard DH).  They differ on the placement and indexing of the frames. • Given the DH Parameters, the forward transformation for a link is a combination of rotations and translations. • We can concatenate forward link transformations to derive the full forward kinematics. DH Parameters allow us to parameterize a robot such that we can describe the relationship between links and joints. Computing the Forward Kinematics from the DH Parameters can be done by chaining multiple transformations following simple rules. Take home message: 44 Thank you for today.
